anywhere anytime.

Highlights 
* The scope of the app extends beyond the AR Clothing, it can match any real life product with user by performing image stitching on the user. 
Thus providing a safer trial for user, while shopping on e-commerce sites, user can visualize the products through their mobile phones.
* Empicisi Augmentation is real-time and in semantic context with environmental elements. 
* AR technology makes information about the surrounding real world of the user interactive and digitally manipulatable.
* Augmented Cognition is implemented to develop a closed-loop system to modulate information flow with respect to the user's cognitive capacity. 
* With this type of live creative tech, consumers can completely immerse themselves in the brand with their whole focus and concentration dedicated to the 
experience and the fact that the content is personalized only to user thus protecting privacy.

##Development
The development phase is divided into 3 parts
Part 1 - Mobile application and Voice Assistant development in Android Studio
Part 2 - Augmented Reality application development in Unity 3D
Part 3 - Intelligence development using NLP and Machine Learning in Python IDLE 3.6

##Mobile application and Voice Assistant development in Android Studio
1. Voice assistance is set up with Google Speech/Text Engine 
2. The corresponding Activities are set to trigger call for Unity AR Application
3. Web view is enabled in order to form a cluster of E-commerce sites interlink
4. The Pane is optimized to provide the Customer preferred items watch list
5. The Purchase phase is initiated by providing in built web view
6. Voice Assistant provides the guidance for the user to perform purchases depending upon the previous search results and preferences

##Augmented Reality application development in Unity 3D
1. Create a Unity application on Android Platform
2. Add Vuforia AR SDK to the build
3. Get a AR camera and get a license for a database from developer portal
4. Add a plain 2D Target database model for the application
5. Include the image database and a 3D modelof .fbx forma in to the Screen
6. Adjust the dimensions to get aproper overlay on the desired object
7. Connect Unity with Android SDK and Oracle JDK
8. Bulid the Apk and deploy it on Android Device

##Intelligence development using NLP and Machine Learning in Python IDLE 3.6
1. Set up a Web Driver Bot using Selenium
2. Get the URL of the targetted webpage and perform Web Harvesting
3. The collected data is sent to NLTK where the sentimental analysis is applied on the data using Support Vector Machines, Regression and Classifers
4. The Resultant data is sent to a Voted Classiifer in ourder to sum up the previous analysis performed
5. The Intelligence returns the result on text format to User.

##Deployment
The Mobile application is deployed on Android phone , the Unity application is coupled with the Android application which triggers the AR action
whenever initiated. The Intelligence operates from the Firebase database.
